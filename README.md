1. Run code with

   > `cargo run`

or if you don't code then just click the .exe file.

2. Program will ask you to type in some search query for Wikipedia (like "bear" or something). Go ahead and type it in and press Enter.

3. The program will print the text content to the console. Doesn't work too well with math-y stuff like equations.
